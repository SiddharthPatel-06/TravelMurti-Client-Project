# TravelMurti-Client-Project

TravelMurti is an easy-to-use online platform that makes travel planning fun and straightforward. Users can browse and manage various travel packages, with secure logins for clients and employees for personalized access. The admin panel allows efficient management of user accounts, roles, and inquiries.

Users can submit inquiries and contact forms, receiving immediate email confirmations, while admins get detailed notifications in a friendly format. We prioritize security by using DOMPurify to protect user data from XSS attacks. The site is responsive, ensuring a great experience on any device.

All user interactions, including inquiries and feedback, are automatically logged into a Google Sheet for easy tracking. Our beautifully designed "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages enhance user engagement. TravelMurti is committed to providing the tools you need for confident and efficient travel planning.
